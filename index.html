    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I am a junior developer currently studying at Hexlet. I'm just starting my journey, so please don't judge me too harshly. Remember, you were once a beginner too. This is the first webpage I'm attempting to create on my own. It may seem really simple to me now, but I hope to look back on it and find it amusing in the future. Let's all strive for success together. Thank you for your attention.</p>
    <p>Just a random list here, I used Emmet for this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Element 1</li>
            <li>Element 2</li>
            <li>Element 3</li>
        </ul>
